# Least Square Estimation
This is a repo of various least square implementations in Python. See the notebooks for more details on each implementation.
## Ordinary Least Square Estimate
- First we will implement a least square fit of a straight line passing through origin. This means, the type of data that can be estimated using this implementation should have no y-intercept. Here is the [example](https://github.com/ygsingh/Least-Square-Estimation/blob/master/least_squares.ipynb) of the implementation.
- Now, lets implement the least square estiamtion for a dataset that may have some y-intercept. See [here]. TODO
- Next step in this line of though is to estiamte data using polynomials. [Here] is an example of this implementation with higher order approximations. TODO
- While studying signal processing and control, especially FFT and Filters, we see signals being approximated using `sin` and `cos` functions. Here is an [example] of least square approximation using trigonometric funcitons. The general idea would remain same for other functions such as exponentials and logarithmic. TODO
